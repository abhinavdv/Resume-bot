RELATED PROJECTS AND RESEARCH PAPERS

Conversational AI Co-Pilot, SLB
July 2024 - Present (Ongoing)
* Developed an enterprise-level AI copilot, facilitating seamless interaction and management of digital portfolios.
* Created reusable AI libraries to streamline AI solution implementation for other teams.
* Utilized the agentic framework for precise query classification and contextual understanding, improving user experience and decreasing support workload through intelligent multi-prompts and a RAG-based approach.
* Leveraged semantic kernel SDK for AI orchestration, enabling MongoDB database queries and API calls for real-time data summarization and retrieval.


Ensemble Based Predictive Model for Streaming Data
* Evaluated the performance of various ensemble regression models on a 34-day solar power generation dataset from a solar power plant in India, using Python, Sci-kit learn, pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. 
* The research utilized adaptive window sizing (ADWIN) and rolling variance-based training to minimize MAPE error.
* The findings were presented at the 12th International Conference on Computing and Networking Technology (ICCNT) and published in  IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9579947.
